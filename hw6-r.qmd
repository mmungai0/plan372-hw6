#Question 1: How many records are there in each state (include a table or bar plot)?

The dataset does not contain a state column, but does contain a city column which contains both city and state information (e.g. Charlotte, NC). Use a regular expression to create separate columns for the city name and state abbreviation, and use these columns to answer the following questions.

Read in data
```{r}
tree = read.csv("TS3_Raw_tree_data.csv")
```

Creating separate columns for city name and state abbreviation
```{r}
# For memory: 
  
unique(tree$City)
all(str_detect(tree$City, "^[:alpha:]+[:punct:] [:upper:]+$"))
#[:punct:] doesn't seem to match when i use str_detect but it returns more or less the right answer when I use str_match


str_match(tree$City, "^([:alpha:]+[:punct:]) ([:upper:]+)$")

tree[,c("city", "state")] = str_match(tree$City, "^([:alpha:]+[:punct:]) ([:upper:]+)$")[,2:3]

table(tree$state)
```

Creating a bar plot for the records in each state
```{r}
tree |>
  ggplot(aes(x=state)) + geom_bar() 

```

```{r}

```
